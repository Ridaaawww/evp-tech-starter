## Idea I Want to Build at EVP ðŸš€
**CallSense** â€“ A low-cost assistive tool for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to understand phone calls.  
It combines real-time **speech-to-text** with **vibration alerts**, so users donâ€™t miss important calls and can follow conversations.  
I believe it can create real social impact while being affordable and scalable.
