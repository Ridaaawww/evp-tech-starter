Hi there Ibrahim Hassan here 
from lords institute of engineering and technology
Doing my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication
i believe that i have a speciality in frontend but when compared to actual front end devs i lack many things , i have a peculiar interest in Embedded Systems and Cloud Computing for which im learning python and Computer networks currently

The product want to build at EVP is 

A smart parking app which shows avaialble parking spots in aparking lot so you dont waste any time looking for a spot to park your car, this could be one USp and an another USP would be people knowing an exact spot where they've parked their vehicle so that it can be retrieved easily and incase they forget where they've parked their vehicle , this app could save their important time  . this idea got me into the pre incubation program too 

Another Idea i wanted to share is 

A portable water heater and cooler which can be easily carried and when required either heats or cools a certain amount ot water at a time like aroudn 3-4 gallons . i maybe completly wrong but i had this wild idea since a long time git config --global user.name "Ibrahim Hassan"
git config --global user.email "yourgithubemail@example.com"
