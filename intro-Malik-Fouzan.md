Hello there

I am Malik Fouzan Khan. 
CS engineer from Matrusri Engineering College.

I do not have much of a hands-on experience but i would be interested in MERN stack. Another domain which has huge of my interests is the domain of AI/DS/ML.
I have a little experience in python and C/C++ especially when we talk about DSA. 

I have this idea of creating an internal website/application for EVP. I have a basic wireframe for this idea too. 
    The landing page will show (Number of CLs, Number of startups incubated at EVP) and information regarding EVP or maybe something that meraj says.
    
    A section where all the CLs are listed and each list item, when clicked, takes you to their profile where in details of that particular CLs can be seen.
    
    Similarly for startups and teams separate sections will be dedicated.

    The application will have hierarchical access 
        i. CLs (who can only view and edit their own profile)
        ii. Admins (who can view and edit people)

    A notice board/announcements page wherein all the useful information can be put regarding events/announcements etc.

    WHY?
    Recently i noticed two issues at EVP(not sure if others feel the same too)
        i. New CLs are too shy to even ask about EVP, its people and all the startups and teams that are at work here. List of CLs, startups(along with its founders ofc) and teams solves this issue. (I personally faced this issue for months).
        
        ii. People are missing important messages in the group due to excess chatting. Announcements board can solve it.
