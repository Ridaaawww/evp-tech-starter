Name: Syed Mamoon Mahasin

Colleges: Shadan College of Engineering and Technology, IIT Madras

Role/Speciality: My favourite language since I got introduced to programming has been python. I got intrigued by something more fascinating 'the capabilities of AI' and I shifted my complete focus to AI. I specialize in using all kinds of different AI tools in different sectors. I am quick to understand the strenghts and shortcomings of different AI tools, softwares and models launching every now and then. But, my love for AI does not stops me from exploring and learning different domains of engineering. Hence I safely think of my self as a life long learner.

Idea: Given my interest in various fields of technology, I want to create a SAAS product which will combine my love for Graphic Designing and my passion for AI in one single software. The software will be a helping hand to the people in the non creative fields.
